@Sympathy is a knife+
I don't wanna share the space
I don't wanna force a smile
This one girl taps my insecurities
Don't know if it's real or if I'm spiraling
One voice tells me that they laugh
George says I'm just paranoid
Says you just don't see it, you're so naive
I'm embarrassed to have it but need the sympathy

'Cause I couldn't even be her if I tried
I'm opposite, I'm on the other side
I feel all these feelings I can't control
Oh no, don't know why
All this sympathy is just a knife
Why I can't even grit my teeth and lie?
I feel all these feelings I can't control
Oh no, don't know

Why I wanna buy a gun?
Why I wanna shoot myself?
Volatile at war with my dialogue
I'd say that there was a God if they could stop this
Wild voice tearing me apart
I'm so apprehensive now
Don't wanna see her backstage at my boyfriend's show
Fingers crossed behind my back
I hope they break up quick

'Cause I couldn't even be her if I tried
I'm opposite, I'm on the other side
I feel all these feelings I can't control
Oh no, don't know why
All this sympathy is just a knife
Why I can't even grit my teeth and lie?
I feel all these feelings I can't control (oh no)

All this sympathy is just a knife
All this sympathy is just a life
All this sympathy is just a knife
Yeah, all this sympathy is just a life
Oh no, oh no
Why is all this sympathy a f*cking knife?
Yeah, all this sympathy is just a knife
Couldn't even be her if I tried

@I might say something stupid+
I might say something stupid
Talk to myself in the mirror
Wear these clothes as disguise
Just to re-enter the party
Door is open, let in but still outside
I look perfect for the background
I get nervous, sip the wine

I go so cold, I go so cold
'Cause I don't know if I belong here anymore, I

I don't feel like nothing special
I snag my tights out on the lawn chair
Guess I'm a mess and play the role
Used to live just for the party, door is open
I'm famous but not quite
But I'm perfect for the background
One foot in a normal life

I go so cold, I go so cold
And I don't know if I belong here anymore, I



@Talk talk+
I've been lookin' at you
Puttin' holes in your head
We've been talking for months
But never in the same room
Now I wanna approach ya
But we've been keeping this a secret
When you're surrounded by friends
And I'm just wondering what they know

I wish you'd talk, talk
Wish you'd talk, talk
Wish you'd talk, talk

Are you thinking 'bout me?
I'm kind of thinking you are
I followed you to the bathroom
But then I felt crazy
I'm feeling like I'm on fire
'Cause we've been keeping this a secret
And all your friends are still there
And I'm just wondering what they know

Wish you'd just talk to me, talk to me, talk to
Wish you'd just talk to me, talk to me, talk to
Wish you'd just talk to me, talk to me, talk to

Talk to me in French
Talk to me in Spanish
Talk to me in your own made-up language
Doesn't matter if I understand it
Talk right in my ear
Tell me your secrets and fears
Once you talk to me, I'll talk to you
And say, "Hey, let's get out of here
Shall we go back to my place?"

@Rewind+

Sometimes, I just wanna rewind
Sometimes (sometimes, sometimes)
I just wanna rewind

I'd go back in time to when I wasn't insecure
To when I didn't overanalyze my face shape
Nowadays, I only eat at the good restaurants
But, honestly, I'm always thinking 'bout my weight
I used to never feel embarrassed (feel embarrassed)
When I call out the paparazzi
Everyone else does it constantly
I hate these doubts that keep running through my mind
Sometimes I really think it would be cool to rewind

Sometimes, I just wanna rewind
Sometimes (sometimes, sometimes)
I just wanna rewind

Used to burn CDs full of songs I didn't know
Used to sit in my bedroom, putting polish on my toes
Recently, I've been thinking 'bout a way simpler time
Sometimes, I really think it would be cool to rewind
I used to never think about Billboard
But now I've started thinking again
Wondering 'bout whether I think I deserve commercial success
It's running through my mind
Sometimes, I really think it would be cool to rewind

Sometimes, I just wanna rewind
Sometimes (sometimes, sometimes)
I just wanna rewind

Sometimes, times

Mmm
Sometimes, I just wanna rewind
Wanna turn back time to a different time
Ooh, sometimes
I just wanna rewind, I just wanna rewind
I just wanna rewind
Let's rewind, yeah
Yeah, press rewind, yeah
Bring the beat back
Press rewind
Yeah, yeah, press rewind

@So I+
Always on my mind (Every day, every night)
Your star burns so bright (Why did I push you away?)
I was scared sometimes
You had a power like a lightning strike
When I'm on stage, sometimes I lie
Say that I love singing these songs you left behind
And I know you always said, "It's okay to cry"
So I know I can cry, I can cry, so I cry

Wish I tried to pull you closer
You pushed me hard, made me focus
Your words, brutal, loving, truthful
I was petrified
You're a hero and a human
Track was done, I'd make excuses
You'd say, "Come on, stay for dinner"
I'd say, "No, I'm fine" (Now I really wish I'd stayed)

Always on my mind (Every day, every night)
Your star burns so bright (Why did I push you away?)
I was scared sometimes
You had a power like a lightning strike
When I'm on stage, sometimes I lie
Say that I love singing these songs you left behind
And I know you always said, "It's okay to cry"
So I know I can cry, I can cry, so I cry

Guilty feelings keep me fractured
Got a phone call after Christmas
Didn't know how I should act
I watched you dance online
Your sounds, your words live on, endless
When I make songs, I remember
Things you'd suggest, "Make it faster"
Would you like this one? (Maybe just a little bit?)

Always on my mind (Every day, every night)

Yeah, I don't know if you like me
Sometimes I think you might hate me
Sometimes I think I might hate you
Maybe you just wanna be me
You always say, "Let's go out"
So we go eat at a restaurant
Sometimes it feels a bit awkward
'Cause we don't have much in common

People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
We talk about making music
But I don't know if it's honest
Can't tell if you wanna see me
Falling over and failing
And you can't tell what you're feeling
I think I know how you feel

You're all about writing poems
But I'm about throwing parties
Think you should come to my party
And put your hands up
I think we're totally different
But opposites do attract
Maybe we're so meant to be
Just you and me

'Cause people say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
One day we might make some music
The internet would go crazy
But you might still wanna see me
Falling over and failing
At least we're closer to being
On the same page

@Apple+

I guess the apple don't fall far from the tree
'Cause I've been looking at you so long
Now I only see me
I wanna throw the apple into the sky
Feels like you never understand me
So I just wanna drive

To the airport, the airport
The airport, the airport

I guess the apple could turn yellow or green
I know there's lots of different nuances
To you and to me
I wanna grow the apple, keep all the seeds
But I can't help but get so angry
You don't listen to me

To the airport, the airport
The airport, the airport
The airport, the airport
The airport, the airport

I'm gonna drive, gonna drive all night
I'm gonna drive, gonna drive all night

I think the apple's rotten right to the core
From all the things passed down
From all the apples coming before
I split the apple down symmetrical lines
And what I find is kinda scary
Makes me just wanna drive
(Drive, drive, drive, dr-dr-dr-drive, drive, drive)
(I'm gonna drive, gonna drive all night)
(I'm gonna drive, gonna drive all night)
(Drive, drive, drive, dr-dr-dr-drive, drive, drive)

I know where you go

When you're feeling alone, do you

Yeah, it's 2 a.m., and she's out there
In the sheer white dress, wearing last night's makeup
All coquette-ish in the pictures with the flash on
Worships Lana Del Rey in her AirPods, yeah
Yeah, she's in her mid-twenties, real intelligent
Hedonistic with the gravel drawl and dead eyes
You said she's anorexic and you heard she likes when people say it
Think you already know it, but you don't

With the razor-sharp tongue stuck to skinny cigarettes
Calls him daddy while she's fingering a gold cross
And she's kinda f*cked up, but she's still en vogue
Yeah, she's in her mid-twenties, real intelligent
And you hate the fact she's New York City's darling
You say she's problematic and the way you say it, so fanatic
Think she already knows that you're obsessed

@I think about it all the time+

I think about it all the time
That I might run out of time
But I finally met my baby
And a baby might be mine
'Cause maybe one day I might
If I don't run out of time
Would it give my life a new purpose?

I was walking around in Stockholm
Seriously thinking 'bout my future for the first time
It was ice cold, playing demos on my iPhone
I went to my friend's place and I met their baby for the first time
How sublime
What a joy, oh my, oh my
Standing there
Same old clothes she wore before, holding her child, yeah
She's a radiant mother and he's a beautiful father
And now they both know these things that I don't

I think about it all the time
That I might run out of time
But I finally met my baby
And a baby might be mine
'Cause maybe one day I might
If I don't run out of time
Would it make me miss all my freedom?
I think about it all the time
I-I think about it all the time
That I might run out of time
But I finally met my baby
And a baby might be mine
'Cause maybe one day I might
If I don't run out of time
Would it give my life a new purpose?
I think about it all the time

And they're exactly the same, but they're different now
And I'm so scared I'm missin' out on something
So, we had a conversation on the way home
Should I stop my birth control?
'Cause my career feels so small in the existential scheme of it all

I think about it all the time
