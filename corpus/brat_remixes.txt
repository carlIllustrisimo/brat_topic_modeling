360 featuring robyn & yung lean+

They-they-they all wanna sound like me
All wanna be like Lean
Dress so fresh and so clean
Rock with the diamonds on the sleeve
Breathing in the Stockholm breeze
Get with Robyn on the beat (Uh)
Ayy, get with Robyn on the beat (Sweet)
Cameras flashing, hit the scene
With Robyn and Charli, pull up to the party
Three white lines split the lime and the Barcardi
Icons in the flesh, you're just a demon at a party
Mayor of my town, David Beckham in the noughties
Yeah, I hear it calling
Pick it up, darling, London calling
When I go prancing, yeah, I go all in

Hey, why you do it so cold?
I'm the realest ever, yeah
That's what I've been told
Killin' this shit since 1994
Got everybody in the club dancing on their own

I got that supersonic, push up on it
Right in your ear
I got that supersonic, starship, comet
Right over here
I'm in my Elvis moment, push up on it
Right over there
I got that supersonic, push up on it
Right in your ear

(We got that) Mansion, castle
(Got that) Pets, family
(Got that) Drinks, action
(We got that) Lights, camera, action

Got that really very special language, no one understands it
Three child stars out here doing damage
Me and Lean and Robyn, we don't even have to practice
We got many hits, get you feeling nostalgic
I started so young, I didn't even have email
Now my lyrics on your booby
Baby on my arm
Your favorite pop star is into me, Yung Lean, and Charli
Know you wanna dream like Lean, wanna be like Lean
But it's not as easy as it seems
Who do I trust? Me
We put this shit together so carelessly

Hey, why you do it so cold?
They say I'm the realest ever, yeah
That's what I've been told
Killin' this shit since 1994
We do this one night, yeah, we do it for our lives

'Cause we got that supersonic, push up on it
Right in your ear
I got that supersonic, starship, comet
Right over here (Yeah)
I'm in my Elvis moment, push up on it
Right over there
I got that supersonic, push up on it
Right in your ear (Let's go)

(We got that) Mansion, castle (Yeah, yeah)
(Got that) Pets, family
(Got that) Drinks, action
(We got that) Lights, camera, action
(Got that) Mansion, castle (Yeah, yeah)

@Sympathy is a knife featuring ariana grande+

I-i-i-i-it's a knife when you know they're waitin' for you to choke
It's a knife when a journalist does a misquote
It's a knife when a friend is suddenly steppin' on your throat
It's a kn— when they say that you've been doing things you don't-don't
It's a knife when your old friends hate your new friends
When somebody says, "Charli, I think you've totally changed"
It's a knife when somebody says they like the old me and not the new me
And I'm like, "Who the f*ck is she?"

'Cause it's a knife whеn you're finally on top
'Cause logically the nеxt step is they wanna see you fall to the bottom
It's a knife when you're finally on top (On top)
'Cause logically the next step is they wanna see you fall-fall-fall

I-i-i-i-it's a knife when
It's a knife when, it's a knife when (When, when)
All this sympathy is just a knife when (When)
It's a knife when, it's a knife when (When, when)
All this sympathy is just a—

It's a knife when you know they're counting on your mistakes
It's a knife when you're so pretty, they think it must be fake (Mm)
It's a knife when they dissect your body on the front page (Mm, ooh)
It's a knife when they won't believe you, why should you explain? (Yeah)
It's a knife when the mean fans hate the nice fans
When somebody says, "Ari, I think you've totally changed" (No shit)
(It's a knife) When somebody says they like the old me and not the new me
And I'm like, "Who the f*ck is she?"

@I might say something stupid featuring the 1975 & jon hopkins+

I could say something smart
But might say something stupid
(Talk to myself in the mirror)
I get so cold (So cold)
I don't know if I belong here anymore

Rot in your house in a tie
Putting my skin into anything
I eat a lot like a fly
I get nervous and sip the wine
Don't worry, it's pretty common
It happens to lots of guys
Medicine makes me a problem
"I'm famous, but I'm not quite"

Rot in my house in L.A.
Thinkin' of givin' up everything
Now I'm watchin' what I say
These interviews are so serious
My friends went through this before, yeah
It happens to lots of guys
Medicine makеs him a problem
"I'm famous, but I'm not quite"

@Von dutch a. g. cook remix featuring addison rae+

I'm I'm just living that life
Von Dutch, cult classic, but I still pop
Every time my track drops, you're jealous
I'm just living that life
While you're sittin' in your dad's basement
Bet you're disappointed that I'm shinin'
I'm just living that life
Von Dutch, cult classic, but I still pop
Pop the LV cases, watch me do a little globe trot
Got a lot to say about my debut
About my constant revenue
I guess it makes sense 'cause I'm just living that life

You just wanna scream my name
On and on, on and on
'Cause I'm just living that
You just wanna scream my name
On and on, on and on
'Cause I'm just living that life

Made another page just to look at my pics
My tight dress and red lips, I know you want it
I'm just living that life
Linked with Addison on Melrose
Bought some cute clothes and wrote this in the studio
'Cause I'm just living that life
Von Dutch, cult classic, but I still pop
Always give me more views, it's kinda like your day job
Got a lot to say about my debut
'Bout all of the things I do
I guess it makes sense 'cause I'm just living that life

I'm just living that life
I'm just living that life, uh
I'm just living that life
Number one
'Cause I'm just living this life

[Charli XCX & Addison Rae]
You just wanna scream my name
On and on, on and on
'Cause I'm just living that (Life)
You just wanna scream my name
On and on, on and on
'Cause I'm just living that life

All these girls are like
"Ah, can I get a picture?"
And then they go online like (Von Dutch, cult classic, but I still pop)
"Just kidding, I hate you" (Von Dutch, cult classic, but I still pop)
(Von Dutch)
'Cause we're just living that life

Walk to the studio soaking wet
ACAB tag on a bus stop sign
(Everything is)
Catch a face in the windowpane
Oh, what's up, it's me, that's mine
(Everything is)
Sleepyhead 'cause all the f*cking
Foxes kept me awake last night
(Everything is)
Charli calls from a hotel bed
Hungover on Tokyo time
(Everything is)

Hey, girl, what's up, how you been?
I think I need your advice
(It's crazy, I was just thinking of you, what's on your mind?)
I'm trying to shut off my brain
I'm thinking 'bout work all the time
(It's like you're living the dream, but you'rе not living your life)
I knew that you would relatе
I feel smothered by logistics
Need my fingerprints on everything
Trying to feed my relationship
Am I in a slump?
Am I playing back time?
Did I lose my perspective?
Everything's still romantic, right?

Late nights in black silk in East London
Church bells in the distance
Free bleeding in the autumn rain
Fall in love again and again
Late nights in black silk in East London
Church bells in the distance
Free bleeding in the autumn rain
Fall in love again and again

Silver scratch card in the canal
Romantic like six-pound wine
Dark in the park, Celtic graves
Girl throws up from the back of a Lime
Headphones on, I hit play
All things change in the blink of an eye
Charli calls from a photo set
Living that life is romantic, right?

@Rewind featuring bladee+

Sometimes, I just wanna rewind
Wanna turn back time to a different time, oh
Sometimes
I just wanna rewind, I just wanna rewind
I just wanna rewind (Press rewind)

Maybe I need a reality check
Sometimes now I just gotta say less
Count so well, drew lines on my chest
When I look in the mirror, I don't see no reflect
All this money makes me competitive
Gotta get more, living all excess
I must confess, I'm under stress
Turn back the time again

I must confеss, I'm under stress
I'm under prеssure in my head
I'm six feet down beneath myself
I'm tryna catch up with my breath
Even with everything on deck (Yeah, yeah)
I'm only thinking about less
Thinking how to move like chess (Yeah, yeah)
The mirror leaves me unimpressed

Maybe I need a reality check (Yeah, yeah)
Sometimes now I just gotta say less
Wanna see my face all up in the press
When I don't, sometimes I get a little bit depressed (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
L.A. makes me so competitive
Sometimes I wanna wake up dead
I must confess, I'm under stress
Turn back the time again

I'm in the hills, perfectly still
The sun is setting in my will (Yeah, yeah)
My mind is split up like two bills
I pay for everything myself
I kill for everything I feel
360, find a way to deal
The shadow spreads across the field (Oh)
I wanna rewind on the real (Press rewind, yeah)

Yeah, press rewind
Yeah, bring the beat back
Press rewind, yeah
Yeah, press rewind
(Yeah, yeah)
Requiem for everything
Rewind, remind me
Requiem for everything
Rewind, remind me
Requiem for everything
Rewind, remind me (Yeah)
Requiem for everything (Yeah, yeah)
Rewind, remind me (Yeah, yeah)

@So I featuring a. g. cook+

Now I wanna think about all the good times
First met on the outskirts of Stockholm
All of your things in a black suitcase
First day, made Vroom Vroom in the basement
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Head bop hard with your arm up, dancing
Hot pink jacket on, music turned up
Bounce that track, make us late to the party
Now I wanna think about all the good times
First time I ever felt alive on stage
In Texas, in matching latex
That's as cool as I'm ever gonna feel

(Beautiful)

Now I wanna think about all the good times
Me and A.G. on Mulholland
Crazy Uber, straight from a video shoot
Got birthday cake on the way
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Best night ever in Arcosanti
So many friends right there in the audience
When I look back, what the f*ck was I wearing?
Now I wanna think about all the good times
One big smile cracked the whole world open
Sipping green juice, looking so chic
Soft response while you play with the tension
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Like when we took Bibi down to Bubbles
Took our shoes off, ran around barefoot
Played that song we made that day
Now I wanna think about all the good times
DJ set back to back with Twiggy
She was nervous, you were so nice
Said you had the best time with her
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Me and Noonie cried to your songs
No songs ever made us feel that much
Can't explain 'cause it's just too much
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Talking on Zoom in 2020
Red hair brushed out, sat back home
Lyrics back and forth from texts
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Like the first time I heard your music
My ex-boyfriend played your SoundCloud
That moment really changed my life

(No, no, no)
(No, no, no-o-o-o)
(No, no, no)
(No, no, no-o-o-o)
(No, no, no, no)
Now I wanna think about all the good times (No, no, no, no)
(No, no, no, no)
Now I wanna think about all the good times (No, no, no, no)
(No, no, no)
(No, no, no-o-o-o)
(No, no, no)
(No, no, no-o-o-o)
(No, no, no, no)
(No, no, no, no)
(No, no, no, no)
(No, no, no, no)
Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good

Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna
Now I wanna
Now I wanna
Now I wanna

@Girl, so confusing featuring lorde+

Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, how do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
How do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
Man, I don't know, I'm just a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl

Yeah, I don't know if you like me
Sometimes I think you might hate me
Sometimes I think I might hate you
Maybe you just wanna be me
You always say, "Let's go out"
So we go eat at a restaurant
Sometimes it feels a bit awkward
'Cause we don't have much in common

People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
We talk about making music
But I don't know if it's honest
Can't tell if you wanna see me
Falling over and failing
And you can't tell what you're feeling
I think I know how you feel

Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, how do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
How do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
Man, I don't know, I'm just a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl

Well, honestly, I was speechless
When I woke up to your voice note
You told me how you'd been feeling
Let's work it out on the remix
You'd always say, "Let's go out"
But then I'd cancel last minute
I was so lost in my head
And scared to be in your pictures
'Cause for the last couple years
I've been at war in my body
I tried to starve myself thinner
And then I gained all the weight back
I was trapped in the hatred
And your life seemed so awesome
I never thought for a second
My voice was in your head
"Girl, you walk like a bitch"
When I was ten, someone said that
And it's just self-defence
Until you're building a weapon
She believed my projection
And now I totally get it
Forgot that inside the icon
There's still a young girl from Essex

People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
It's you and me on the coin
The industry loves to spend
And when we put this to bed
The internet will go crazy
I'm glad I know how you feel
'Cause I ride for you, Charli (Charli, Charli)

Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, how do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
How do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
Man, I don't know, I'm just a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl

Girl, girl
(It's so confusing)
Girl, girl, girl, girl
You know I ride for you, too
(It's so confusing-ing)

Know it's something I might regret

Somebody asked me how you're doing
And I make excuses and I say you're fine
I keep trying not to think about you, but I
Seem to think about you all the time

And you make me
(I've been looking at you so long, now I only see me)
You make me so sad, so sad
(I've been looking at you so long, now I only see me)
And you make me
(I've been looking at you so long, now I only see me)
You're making me so sad, so sad
(I've been looking at you so long, now I only see me)

Sometimes when I go home
It doesn't feel like home
Don't know if you can hear me
Inside this conversation
Sometimes when I go home
It doesn't feel like home
Silently pack my things, get in the car
I just wanna drive, drive, drive, drive, drive
You know I just wanna drive, drive, drive, drive, drive
You know I just wanna drive, drive, drive, drive, drive
You know I just wanna drive, drive, drive, drive
You know I just wanna drive

Now everybody wants what we got (Yeah)
'Cause we made 'em "Boom Clap," made 'em get "2 On" (Yeah)
All the way from Los Angeles to France (Yeah)
Dix ans plus tard et toujours en place (Yeah)
Yeah, we work hard, yeah, we work hard (Back to back)

Boutta run it back
The way my ass look in these jeans, I'm boutta throw it back (Back, back)
When they see us out here winning, they get so mad
Now I'm feeling on myself, I don't know how to act (Act, act, act, act)
Look at me now, better than before (Yeah, yeah)
They wanna be like me, can't even blame them for it (Oh)
Didn't come out of nowhere, they been sleeping on me, I'm bored
Look so good on your mood board (Yeah, we work hard, yeah)

'Cause I go back to back to back to back to back to back to back (Back to back)
Back to back to back to back to back (Back to back)

Why do you search your heart?
(I think about it all the time, that I might run out of time)
Why do you choose to move?
('Cause maybe one day I might)
I'll take your silences
Fix 'em for customs, the signals makе motion
You're lonely and you're (Scarеd to run out of time)
And you're asking, "When did it get so hard?"
Yeah (When did it get so hard? When did it get so hard?)
(When did it get so hard? When did it g—) Yeah

First off, you're bound to the album
Then you're locked into the promo
Next thing, three years have gone by (Scared to run out of time)
Me and George sit down and try to plan for our future
But there's so much guilt involved when we stop working
'Cause you're not supposed to stop when things start working, no

I'm so scared to run out of time
I'm so scared
Scared to run out of time, I
I think about it all the time
I'm scared to run out of time

'Cause our love ran out of time
Love in the nick of time
I found love

@Guess featuring Billie Eilish+

Hey, Billie, you there?
Uh-uh

You wanna guess the colour of my underwear
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about (Yeah)

Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious

Don't have to guess the color of your underwear
Already know what you've got goin' on down there
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about

I wanna try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Kiss it, ride it, can I fit it?
Charli likes boys, but she knows I'd hit it

Charli, call me if you're with it

Yeah, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess
Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess
Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess
Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess

You wanna guess what me and Billie have been textin' about? (We've been disrespectful)
Still tryin' to guess the password to my Google Drive (Are you obsessed with me?)
You wanna guess the address of the party we're at (You know you're not invited)
You wanna guess if we're serious about this song
